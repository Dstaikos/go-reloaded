Text Completion & Auto-Correction Tool

üìñ Description

This project is a text completion and correction tool written in Go.

It takes an input text file, applies a series of automatic corrections and transformations, and writes the modified text into an output file.

The purpose is to simulate a small-scale text editor capable of fixing grammar, formatting, and capitalization ‚Äî automatically!


How it works

You run your program like this:  go run . input.txt output.txt

The program will read the contents of input.txt, apply all transformation rules, and write the corrected version to output.txt.


Features & Rules


üî¢ Number Conversions

(hex) ‚û°Ô∏è Converts the previous hexadecimal number to decimal

"1E (hex) files were added" ‚Üí "30 files were added"

(bin) ‚û°Ô∏è Converts the previous binary number to decimal

"It has been 10 (bin) years" ‚Üí "It has been 2 years"

üî§ Text Case Modifiers

(up) ‚û°Ô∏è Turns the previous word UPPERCASE

"Ready, set, go (up)!" ‚Üí "Ready, set, GO!"

(low) ‚û°Ô∏è Turns the previous word lowercase

"STOP SHOUTING (low)" ‚Üí "STOP shouting"

(cap) ‚û°Ô∏è Capitalizes the previous word

"welcome to the bridge (cap)" ‚Üí "Welcome to the Bridge"


You can also apply them to multiple words using a number:

"This is so exciting (up, 2)" ‚Üí "This is SO EXCITING"



Punctuation Rules

Punctuation marks . , ! ? : ; should:

Stick to the previous word (no space before)

Be followed by one space (no double or missing spaces)

Example:

"I was sitting over there ,and then BAMM !!" ‚Üí "I was sitting over there, and then BAMM!!"



For grouped punctuations (like ... or !?), treat them as one unit:

"I was thinking ... You were right" ‚Üí "I was thinking... You were right"



Quotation Formatting

Single quotes ' ' should hug the inner words tightly, without spaces.

"I am ' awesome '" ‚Üí "I am 'awesome'"

If there are multiple words inside, the quotes still stay tight:

"As Elton John said: ' I am the most well-known homosexual in the world '" ‚Üí "As Elton John said: 'I am the most well-known homosexual in the world'"



Article Correction

When "a" or "A" is followed by a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) or h, it becomes "an" or "An" respectively.

"A amazing rock" ‚Üí "An amazing rock"

"a honest man" ‚Üí "an honest man"
