<h1>Text Completion & Auto-Correction Tool</h1>

<h2>ðŸ“– Description</h2>

<h4>This project is a text completion and correction tool written in Go.


It takes an input text file, applies a series of automatic corrections and transformations, and writes the modified text into an output file.


The purpose is to simulate a small-scale text editor capable of fixing grammar, formatting, and capitalization â€” automatically!</h4>


<h3>How it works:</h3>

You run your program like this:  

```
go run main.go input.txt output.txt

```

The program will read the contents of input.txt, apply all transformation rules, and write the corrected version to output.txt.
