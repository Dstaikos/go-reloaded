A powerful text processing and auto-correction tool written in Go that applies intelligent transformations to text files.

## Features

- 🔢 **Number Base Conversion** - Convert hexadecimal and binary numbers to decimal
- 🔤 **Text Case Transformation** - Apply uppercase, lowercase, and capitalization rules
- 📝 **Smart Punctuation** - Automatic spacing and formatting correction
- 💬 **Quote Normalization** - Proper single quote pairing and spacing
- 📖 **Article Correction** - Intelligent "a" to "an" replacements
- ⚡ **Batch Processing** - Apply transformations to multiple words at once

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or higher

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-reloaded.git
cd go-reloaded
```

### Usage

```bash
cd cmd
go run main.go input.txt output.txt
```

##  Examples

### 🔢 Number Conversions
```
Input:  "1E (hex) files were added"
Output: "30 files were added"

Input:  "It has been 10 (bin) years"
Output: "It has been 2 years"
```

### 🔤 Text Transformations
