Live Understanding & Recoding

I asked for handling “a/an” more intelligently with capitalization in case it's the start of a sentence or there is a dot prior to "a/an"

Author then walked me through his code and suggested to add a new check inside 'anconv.go' file.
It would loop backwards from 'a/an', skipping all spaces and checking if the first character is a dot. Also if there are no other characters other than space,
it means it's the start of a sentence, so it would need to become capitilized too.
